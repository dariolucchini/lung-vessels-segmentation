# Lung vessels segmentation with MATLAB
This code has been made with the purpose of segmenting vessels from a set of CT scans of the lungs. It starts by applying a highpass emphasize filter to each image. This filter is obtained by first utilizing an average filter and then an highpass filter, corrected with an offset and a scaling factor. Filtering aims for denoising the
original image to improve its quality. The filtered image is now cleaner and with uniform illumination, therefore, easier to segment.
The region growth algorithm applied after filtering starts with seed selection. In this case it has been done manually, selecting two points (one for each lung) directly from the image. The algorithm then adds points to the region by comparing all neighbouring pixels' value, which are not part of the region, and the mean value of the region; the pixel with the value closer to the region is added. This continues until the value of the closest neighbouring pixel is too different from the mean value. The difference is decided by a defined value: the treshold.
There are two sets of images: filtered (file name: FINAL) and not filtered (SEGMENTATION)
